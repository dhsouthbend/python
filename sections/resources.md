# Python resources

[Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) - An example-driven introduction to Python.

[How to Think Like a Computer Scientist - Python Edition](https://runestone.academy/runestone/static/thinkcspy/index.html) - A good intro if you're also interested in learning basic computer science concepts.

[Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) - A fun book that teaches Python while automating some common (and annoying) tasks.

[CodeAcademy: Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3) - An interactive tutorial for learning the basics of Python. (I recommend trying the books above first, as learning to use a text editor or IDE such as IPython or IDLE is an important part of the learning curve.) A good supplemental resource. 

[Hands-on Python Tutorial](https://anh.cs.luc.edu/python/hands-on/3.1/handsonHtml/index.html) - A more exhaustive introductory course to Python by Dr. Andrew N. Harrington; includes video demo downloads and lots of practice activities. It's all free to use!
