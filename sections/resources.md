# Python resources


[Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) - A fun book that teaches Python while automating some common (and annoying) tasks.

[Introduction To Python for Humanists](https://python-textbook.pythonhumanities.com/intro.html) - Free online version of a humanities-centric book on learning Python by a Yale Cultural Heritage Data Scientist.

[How to Think Like a Computer Scientist - Python Edition](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/index.html) - A good intro if you're also interested in learning basic computer science concepts. Free to use, but donations solicited.

[CodeAcademy: Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3) - An interactive tutorial for learning the basics of Python. (I recommend trying the books above first, as learning to use a text editor or IDE such as IPython or IDLE is an important part of the learning curve.) A good supplemental resource.
