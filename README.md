# Introduction to Python

Python is a general-purpose programming language that is suitable for a wide variety of core tasks in the digital humanities. Learning Python fundamentals is a gateway to analyzing data, creating visualizations, composing interactive websites, scraping the internet, and engaging in distant reading of texts.

By the end of this workshop, participants will:

- **Understand what Python is** and, in general terms, what it can do.
- **Run Python programs**, both by interacting directly with the interpreter and by preparing and running scripts.
- **Distinguish among five core data types**â€”integers, floats, strings, booleans, and lists.
- Become familiar with core programming concepts, including **variables, loops, and conditionals**.
- **Engage with error output** and use the internet and documentation to independently research language features.
- Learn how to **find and import code from external sources** to solve more complex problems.
